            <h3>How to Design a Home?</h3>
            <p>In most cases, designing a home means that you’ll work with an architect to draw up plans for a builder. <br><br>
                The architect brings experience and expertise to the table. They know what’s realistic, and they can warn you about potential pitfalls in your design. <br><br>
                They might have a perspective you don’t have — for example, they can tell you if a design feature will increase or decrease the home’s resale value. <br><br>
                The design can still be all yours. This is your home, and the architect is there to help you make your dreams a reality. <br><br>            
                Whether you have an architect or not, the steps below will help you create the perfect design and communicate it effectively.</p>
